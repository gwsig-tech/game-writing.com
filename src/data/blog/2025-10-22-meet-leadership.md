Just over a month ago, we shared the news about [A SIG Reconstituted](/posts/a-sig-reconstituted/)—the revival of the IGDA Game Writing SIG through a Constitutional Convention and the launch of this new website. Since then, we've been hard at work building momentum and establishing the foundations for our community's future.

Today, we're excited to introduce you to the committee members who are leading this renewed organization and share what we've been working on.

## Your Committee

The Game Writing SIG is now governed by a committee of volunteers who have stepped up to serve the community through various initiatives. Here's who's leading the charge:

[**Justin Bortnick**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-bortnick/) - Executive Panel, Chair, Treasurer  
Initiative: Handbook  
Justin leads our committee meetings and maintains financial oversight while spearheading the development of our organizational handbook.

[**Tobias Heussner**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theussner/) - Executive Panel  
Initiative: Moderation  
Tobias provides executive oversight and works to ensure our digital spaces remain safe and productive for all members.

[**Chride Lassheikki**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christina-lassheikki/)  
Initiative: Game Jams & Events  
Chride is coordinating our event programming, including the first SIG narrative game jam.

[**Jon Myers**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathonmyers/) - Tech Officer, Interim Secretary  
Initiative: Digital Presence  
Jon maintains our technical infrastructure, including this website, digital accounts, and committee workflows.

[**Andrea Saravia Pérez**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasaraviaperez/)  
Initiative: Resources  
Andrea is building an online publication and database of resources relevant to working game writers.

[**Sam Webb**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samwebb-conjetteart/) - Lead Moderator  
Initiative: Moderation  
Sam leads our Discord moderation team and works to establish formal guidelines and training procedures.

## What We've Been Up To

Since launching in September, we've made significant progress:

* **Digital Infrastructure**: We've centralized our accounts, set up shared email inboxes for committee coordination, and deployed a password management system for secure access to SIG resources.

* **Community Spaces**: We've made initiative channels public where possible and established better workflows for community participation in our various projects.

* **Website Development**: We've launched a [rudimentary calendar/events page](/events) and a prototype wiki for the resources initiative. Our itch.io page is now connected for an upcoming game jam to be announced this Friday.

* **Records**: Committee meeting records are now being published regularly, and we've formalized our procedures for committee member appointments and decision-making.

* **IGDA Partnership**: Besides attending monthly IGDA SIG leadership meetings, we've received edit access to the SIG's IGDA page and access to relevant documents in their Google Drive folder. SIG leadership and IGDA leadership regularly communicate in shared channels of our respective Discord servers.

## What's Next

Looking ahead, we have several exciting initiatives in development:

### Upcoming Game Jam

We're preparing to launch a SIG narrative game jam, with details to be announced on Friday. We're seeking additional prizes, as well as senior level volunteers who could help mentor participants the weekend of Nov 21.

### GDC Presence

We've submitted to the GDC IGDA SIG roundtable, continuing our tradition of engagement at major industry events. As we learn more about this year's GDC we'll let everyone know the plan.

### Resources Database

Andrea is making progress on a comprehensive public database of resources for game writers. This will become a central reference point for our community, attempting to answer many industry Frequently Asked Questions.

### Social Media Growth

We are working with volunteers to help manage our social media presence and grow our community across platforms. Chances are, you're reading this because you clicked on a social media link!

## How You Can Get Involved

The SIG operates on a model of open governance, which means **your participation matters** and we're here to empower you. Here's how you can contribute:

* **Volunteer for Initiatives**: Each committee member leads an initiative that welcomes general member participation. Whether you're interested in events, resources, moderation, or technical work, there's a place for you.

* **Attend Committee Meetings**: Our monthly committee meetings are now open for observation to all general members. Contact any committee member to receive an invite. Watch our Discord for announcements on meeting dates and times.

* **Propose New Ideas**: Have an idea for an initiative or project? We want to hear it. Open governance means community members can propose new directions for the SIG.

* **Fill Open Roles**: We have several open positions including additional moderators, a social media manager, and site technical assistants.

* **Participate in Discussions**: Speak up in our Discord to share your constructive ideas and thoughts. We have a #general-volunteers channel and feedback channels for topical discussion and specific questions. We hope to begin regular Town Hall conversations in a new chat channel of our Discord server.

## Looking Forward

This is just the beginning of a renewed chapter for the Game Writing SIG. We're building on more than two decades of history while adapting to serve the needs of today's game writing community.

Whether you're a veteran game writer or just starting your journey, whether you work in AAA, indie, mobile, or emerging platforms—this community is for you. We're here to promote the craft, educate the industry, advocate for our members, and work together toward better narrative in games.

Join us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2uWGBsUgxT) to stay connected with announcements, participate in discussions, and be part of shaping the future of game writing.
