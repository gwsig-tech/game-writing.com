We're thrilled to introduce [Jarory de Jesus](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarory-de-jesus/>) who will be judging the [Game Writing SIG Arcjam](https://www.game-writing.com/posts/arcjam-announcement-2025)!

Jarory de Jesus is a game developer who specializes in narrative design, implementation, and programming. As a developer he’s worked on properties such as *Madden*, *Marvel*, and *Star Wars* as both a Narrative and Technical Designer. Jarory is also a community organizer for Black in Gaming (BiG) and a member of the Latinx in Gaming community as well as President of the board for Global Game Jam. His current studio, [Coquito Games](https://coquitogames.com/), is the culmination of his years of experience and passion for telling stories from under-represented voices.
We asked Jarory some burning questions regarding his background in the game industry, his advice to our game jammers, what he would look for in a portfolio piece, and more! Take a look at his answers below.

## Let's get to know you! How did you originally get into game development?

> “I started out as an anthropologist of all things. After dropping out of my Phd program, I taught myself to code. Ended up really enjoying coding for games and thought it'd be a great medium to tell stories so I went to get a masters in that.”

## We've been going through incredibly tough times in the industry. What keeps you going?

> “Spite? Okay, jokes aside, I have stories I want to tell some day. And knowing that I have a unique background that makes me really the only one likely to tell them makes it important to me and pushes me to keep going. That and I feel like if I gave up I'd let down all the people who helped me get here.”

## We shared some basic advice for our jammers [in this blog post](https://www.game-writing.com/posts/prepare-for-arcjam). What's your #1 tip for our game jammers?

> “Scope small and build on that idea only if you have time. One or two well polished and fun moments are better than 5 or 6 mediocre ones.”

## Learning new tech can be quite daunting, but is vital to a career in game narrative. How do you approach learning new technical skills?

> "I'm lucky that I'm technical already, but honestly just playing around with a tool and reading the documentation helps a lot.”

## Finally — What do you like to see in a game narrative portfolio piece?

> “Dialogue with examples of branching narrative, bark sheets, and data bank entries. Also if you can implement those, even if it's just in twine, it goes a long way.”
