## What the Judges Will Evaluate

Our judges will assess the shortlisted games across three main categories:

**Storytelling** \- How effectively does the narrative engage players? Does it demonstrate strong character voice, world-building, or emotional resonance?

**Gameplay** \- How well do the interactive mechanics serve the story? Is the player agency meaningful?

**Theme Interpretation** \- How creatively and organically does the game incorporate the jam's theme?

Beyond scoring these categories, the judges will provide each shortlisted game with personalized feedback on how well the game functions as a **portfolio piece** \- helping those writers to understand what works and what could be strengthened for showcasing narrative design skills to potential employers or collaborators.

## Special Awards

In addition to the overall winners determined by combined judge and community scores, our panel will vote on three special recognition awards:

* **Excellence in Writing Craft** \- At the core of writing craft we find the prose itself. Here, we look for a game that uses language and words in masterful ways, whether it's to grip our emotions, weave together spellbinding descriptions, carry us to faraway places, or for something unexpected. Like a smooth dark chocolate melting in your mouth, the Excellence in Writing Craft Award goes to a game that leaves us wanting more for the pure joy of taking in the text.  
* **Excellence in Narrative Design** \- Storytelling in games goes beyond the words – from choice design to mechanics to the environment to your systems, narrative can be imbued on every level of the game. Whether simple and elegant, or ridiculously responsive and complex, the Excellence in Narrative Design Award goes to a game that explores and exemplifies the ways in which gameplay meets story.  
* **Innovative Use of Technology** \- A professional game writer must master design tools in order to collaborate with their teammates. Demonstrating technical competency is a critical component of a sustainable career in the games industry. The judges and organizers will look for interesting and imaginative uses of Arcweave. The Innovative Use of Technology Award will go to a game that showcases technical innovation and competency.

These awards celebrate specific aspects of narrative game development and may go to different projects, ensuring multiple teams receive recognition for their unique strengths.
