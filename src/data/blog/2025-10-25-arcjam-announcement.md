We're thrilled to announce the [Game Writing SIG ArcJam](https://itch.io/jam/game-writing-sig-arcjam-2025) — our first narrative-focused game jam of the new SIG era, happening this November in partnership with [Arcweave](https://arcweave.com)!

This 72-hour online event is organized specifically for working game writers, narrative designers, and game industry members passionate about interactive storytelling. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting your journey in game writing, the Game Writing SIG Arcjam offers a unique opportunity to flex your creative muscles, build your portfolio, and connect with our community during a challenging time in the industry.

## Why We're Doing This

Let's be honest: these are difficult times for game writers. The industry has seen significant layoffs, projects canceled, and opportunities dry up. In moments like these, community matters more than ever.

The Game Writing SIG Arcjam is our answer to this moment. We're creating a space where writers can:

* **Build portfolio pieces** that showcase their narrative design skills
* **Experiment with new techniques** in a supportive, low-pressure environment
* **Connect with peers** who understand the challenges we're facing
* **Have fun** telling stories and playing with interactive narrative

Most importantly, we want to boost morale and remind everyone why we do this work in the first place — because interactive storytelling is powerful, meaningful, and worth fighting for.

## About Arcweave

We're partnering with [Arcweave](https://arcweave.com), a cutting-edge narrative design tool that makes it easy to create branching, interactive stories. All jam entries will be created using Arcweave's platform, giving participants a chance to learn or deepen their skills with professional-grade narrative design software.

Arcweave has generously provided:

* **Free Pro workspace access** for all jam participants
* **Priority support** throughout the event via their Discord server
* **Perpetual hosting** for submitted projects
* **Co-promotion** for standout entries

Even if you've never used Arcweave before, don't worry — the platform is intuitive to learn, with comprehensive tutorials and documentation to get you started. Plus, the Arcweave community is always ready to help.

## Looking Ahead

This is just the first event we're planning as part of the renewed SIG. We'll be sharing more details about judges, prizes, and categories in the coming weeks. But today, we want to focus on the most important thing: the opportunity to create together.

Game writing can be an isolating profession, especially in difficult times. The Game Writing SIG Arcjam is a chance to remember that we're not alone — that there's a community of writers out there who understand the challenges, celebrate the victories, and believe in the power of interactive narrative.

So mark your calendars for November 21-24, and get ready to write.
