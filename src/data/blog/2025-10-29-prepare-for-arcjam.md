The [Game Writing SIG Arcjam](https://www.game-writing.com/posts/arcjam-announcement-2025) is just around the corner! Whether you're a seasoned game writer or diving into your first jam, preparation is key to making the most of your 72 hours. Here's how to set yourself up for success.

## Setting Your Goals

Before the jam begins, take some time to clarify what you want to achieve:

**What do you hope to accomplish?** A jam is about more than just finishing a project. Are you experimenting with a new narrative structure? Testing out branching mechanics? Building something for your portfolio? Defining your primary goal helps you stay focused when the clock is ticking.

**What do you want to learn?** This is a perfect opportunity to expand your skillset. Maybe you want to master Arcweave's branching logic, experiment with visual assets, or try collaborative real-time editing. Pick one or two learning objectives and let the jam be your classroom.

**What skills do you want to showcase?** Think about your portfolio. What narrative design strengths do you want potential employers or collaborators to see? Character voice? World-building? Puzzle design? Consider this in advance and let it guide your creative decisions.

**What's a realistic scope?** Here's the truth: 72 hours goes by fast. Plan for something you can complete, playtest, and polish. A tight, focused ~5-7 minute experience will impress judges and players far more than an ambitious but incomplete epic. Remember, you can always expand your story after the jam ends. And don't forget: long, extensive portfolio pieces are seldom completed by the reviewer.

## Learning the Tools

If you're new to Arcweave, don't panic. It's designed with writers in mind, and you don't need to be a tech wizard to create compelling interactive stories. Just start here:

Our partners at Arcweave created this [comprehensive cheatsheet specifically for game writers preparing for the jam](https://blog.arcweave.com/arcweave-cheat-sheet-for-game-writers). It breaks down everything from beginner basics to advanced logic, organized by skill level.

**Key resources:**

- [Arcweave QuickStart Guide](https://blog.arcweave.com/your-arcweave-quickstart-guide) - Get from zero to your first playable story
- [Video Tutorial Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP2s5PcDiBdbJUFiw8gu8gK1IyFboWxFH) - Comprehensive basics coverage
- [Arcweave Documentation](https://docs.arcweave.com) - The complete reference guide

Remember: you don't need to master every feature before the jam starts. Focus on the basics first: elements, connections, and playtesting. You can explore variables and advanced logic as you go.

The [Arcweave Discord community](https://discord.gg/uJMFknx7zM) is incredibly supportive, and they'll be providing priority support throughout the jam weekend.

## Solo or Team: Making the Call

**Going solo** means complete creative control and no coordination overhead. It's perfect if you:

- Have a clear vision you want to execute
- Work best independently
- Want to focus purely on narrative without managing collaborators
- Are using the jam primarily as a learning experience

**Finding a team** can amplify your project and teach you collaborative skills. Consider teaming up if you:

- Want to create something more ambitious in scope
- Have complementary skills to share (writing, art, sound, UI design)
- Thrive on collaborative energy and brainstorming

**Pro tip:** When looking for teammates, be upfront about:

- Your strengths ("Strong dialogue writer, learning branching mechanics")
- Your availability during the jam weekend
- Your goals and expectations
- Your time zone (if working internationally)

Non-writer collaborators (artists, sound designers, UI designers) can take your project to the next level. Arcweave makes it easy to integrate visual and audio assets, so even if you're primarily a writer, you can create a rich multimedia experience with the right team.
