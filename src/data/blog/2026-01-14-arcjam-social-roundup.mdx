One of the most rewarding aspects of the inaugural Game Writing SIG Arcjam has been watching our community share their experiences beyond the jam itself. In the days and weeks following the event, participants took to social media (predominantly LinkedIn) to document their creative journeys, showcase their work, and connect with fellow narrative designers.

Our community rallied around these posts, sharing and boosting them through the SIG's social channels. The response demonstrated something special: a community of professionals willing to lift each other up, celebrate each other's accomplishments, and build the kind of supportive network our industry desperately needs.

Below, we've compiled these reflections, post-mortems, and celebrations in the order they were shared with us in our Discord server. Whether you're looking for inspiration for your next jam, curious about different creative processes, or simply want to see the community in action, these posts offer a window into what made Arcjam 2025 so meaningful to those who participated.

## Beyond the Games

These posts represent more than just jam retrospectives. They're evidence of a passionate and talented group game writing professionals. The predominance of LinkedIn posts speaks to the career-focused nature of our organization and the value our members place on showcasing their skills and connecting with industry peers.

Many participants noted this was their first game jam, their first time using Arcweave, or their first complete narrative game. The willingness to document and share these "firsts" publicly demonstrates the supportive atmosphere we're cultivating with the IGDA Game Writing SIG.

Whether you participated in Arcjam 2025 or are considering joining future events, we hope these voices inspire you. Game writing can be an isolating profession, but it doesn't have to be. We're building a community where writers lift each other up, celebrate each other's successes, and prove that resilience isn't just about bouncing back alone.

Thank you to everyone who shared their experiences, and to those who boosted, commented, and engaged with these posts. You've shown what our community can be at its best.
