The wait is over! The theme for the [Game Writing SIG ArcJam](https://itch.io/jam/game-writing-sig-arcjam-2025) theme is:

# RESILIENCE

For the next 72 hours, we invite you to explore this theme through interactive narrative. What does resilience mean to you? How do characters, communities, or systems bounce back from adversity? How can gameplay mechanics express persistence, adaptation, or recovery?

The interpretation is yours. Whether you craft a story about personal growth, survival against the odds, or the strength found in community, do you best to show us resilience in an interactive story.

## Getting Started Right Now

**If you haven't already:**

2. [**Join our Discord server**](https://discord.gg/EStA2uKm4n) - Get your Pro workspace upgrade and connect with other jammers
3. **Create your** [**Arcweave account**](https://arcweave.com/) if you haven't yet

- **Community voting begins**: Immediately after submission deadline
- **Judging period**: November 24 - December 8

## What You're Creating

Remember, you're not just making a game. We also encourage you to complete a **portfolio piece**. All shortlisted games receive personalized feedback from our [expert judge panel](/posts/meet-arcjam-judges) on how well your game functions as a portfolio showcase.

Our community and the judges will evaluate your work on:

- **Storytelling**
- **Gameplay**
- **Theme Interpretation**

> You **DONT'** need a team and you **DON'T** need audiovisual assets to make a game, submit, and **win prizes**. A solo, text-only game will focus your audience entirely on your writing and highlight your ability to craft an interactive story.

## Prizes Await

Don't forget that every submitted game earns a discount reward, and top games compete for [amazing prizes](/posts/arcjam-prizes-announced) including:

- Professional development courses
- Arcweave Pro workspaces
- Career coaching sessions
- Game writing textbooks
- IGDA memberships
- And more!
