After 72 hours of jamming, two weeks of community voting, and careful deliberation by our expert judge panel, we're thrilled to announce the winners of the inaugural **Game Writing SIG Arcjam**!

The theme was **RESILIENCE**, and 123 teams rose to the challenge, creating interactive stories that explored personal growth, survival against the odds, and the strength found in community. Our judges wrote over 200 pieces of feedback, and the community cast 1,383 ratings on itch.io.

You can play the following winning games, as well as the remaining top ten games, on our [2025 Game Writing SIG Arcjam Page](/jams/2025-arcjam)
