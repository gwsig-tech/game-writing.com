After 72 hours of jamming, two weeks of community voting, and careful deliberation by our expert judge panel, we're thrilled to announce the winners of the inaugural **Game Writing SIG Arcjam 2025**!

The theme was **RESILIENCE**, and 123 teams rose to the challenge—creating interactive narratives that explored personal growth, survival against the odds, and the strength found in community. Our judges wrote over 200 pieces of feedback, and the community cast 1,383 ratings on itch.io.

## The Winners

### 🥇 First Place + Community Choice: Moments Away

**Final Score: 8.52** | By DeathBow

*"It turns out, time flies even when you're not having fun."*

<!-- TODO: Add Moments Away screenshot from ceremony -->
![Moments Away](@/assets/images/jam-background.png)

*Moments Away* claimed both the top spot and the Community Choice award, resonating deeply with players and judges alike. Judge Frankie Wakefield-Harrey shared:

> "Moments Away is such a painfully raw and real presentation of grief and the resilience required to wade through it. It is beautifully written and expertly crafted; I both laughed and wept during my playthrough. This is by far one of the most heartbreaking stories I have ever had the privilege to read."

**Prizes:** 2x IGDA Memberships, Arcweave License

### 🥈 Second Place + Excellence in Writing: Launch Day

**Final Score: 8.41** | By Luciano, Dad's Last Nerve, Enneagon, TimSch, KnuxxFG, kaosi

*"700 years and no hope of rescue..."*

<!-- TODO: Add Launch Day screenshot from ceremony -->
![Launch Day](@/assets/images/jam-background.png)

*Launch Day* earned both second place overall and the **Excellence in Writing** special recognition. Both Judge Jon Myers and Judge Frankie Wakefield-Harrey gave this game a perfect score. Jon noted:

> "This was so incredible and polished. The world, characters, and your 'unwanted task' goal as the Player Character are so well and fully realized... the predicament so human that it subtly but explicitly becomes a metaphor for our times. I'm not sure how I would improve upon this. No other notes. Very well done."

**Prizes:** 2x Game Narrative Toolbox, The Video Game Writer's Guide to Surviving an Industry That Hates You (signed by Richard Dansky)

### 🥉 Third Place + Judges' Choice: Piranha Pit

**Final Score: 8.20** | By the Piranha Pit Team

<!-- TODO: Add Piranha Pit screenshot from ceremony -->

*Piranha Pit* earned both third place and the **Judges' Choice** distinction, along with a perfect score from Judge Frankie. Judge Kelly Bender praised the game's craft:

> "I loved the intricacies of the storytelling used, the sound, voice acting, sound effects, images, and overall vibe. It was a fun experience and it felt like my choices truly mattered."

Judge Jarory de Jesus added:

> "It made me a little queasy and gave me Saw vibes, but it made me want to keep going. And the use of sound to get through the maze, truly inspired as far as mechanics go."

**Prizes:** 2x IGDA Memberships, Book: *Branching Story, Unlocked Dialogue: Designing and Writing Visual Novels*

## 4th & 5th Place Highlights

Judge Frankie praised this charming investigation game:

Judge Frankie offered high praise:

> "I believe if the series *Severance*, the game *Unpacking*, and *Stardew Valley* all met up and made a game together, this is what it would look like... I loved the voice acting alongside the dialogue as well, this was a really great way to bring these inanimate and bizarre characters to life."
