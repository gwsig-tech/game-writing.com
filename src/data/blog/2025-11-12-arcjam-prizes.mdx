## Additional Recognition

In addition to prizes and top game placement, shortlisted games are eligible to receive:

**Portfolio Feedback**: All shortlisted games will receive personalized feedback from our expert judges on how well the game functions as a portfolio piece, helping writers understand what works and what could be strengthened for showcasing narrative design skills to potential employers or collaborators.

**Special Recognition Awards**: Judges will award special recognition for [Excellence in Writing Craft, Excellence in Narrative Design, and Innovative Use of Technology](https://www.game-writing.com/posts/meet-arcjam-judges#special-awards).

**Spotlight Features**: Selected projects will be showcased and promoted across IGDA and Arcweave channels and platforms.

## How Prize-Winners Are Determined

Games will be evaluated through community ratings and professional judge evaluations across these three criteria:

- **Storytelling**
- **Gameplay**
- **Theme Interpretation**

Community ratings and peer feedback will take place on the Itch.io platform. Organizers and judges will review and shortlist games for final evaluation. The panel of professional judges will rate the shortlisted games and vote to determine the top games and award recipients.
